# SVG = The better replacement of Flash?

---

# Small file size

Yet crisp on any resolution

---

# JS accessible for easier manipulation

- Animation
- Effects
- Interactivity

---

# Lots of open-source libraries 

- snap.svg http://snapsvg.io/demos/#coffee
- anime.js
- velocity.js
- vivus.js (Best for animating icons and logos) https://maxwellito.github.io/vivus/ (Vivus instant to animate your SVG icons on the fly)

# Opinion

Easier to grasp than Canvas (more intuitive)

---

# Accessible (unlike canvas)

- All elements of an SVG are available in the page and can have accessibility attributes such as *aria-role*, *title*, *desc*
- Don't make use of *aria-labelledby*, *aria-labels*, *aria-describedby*, *aria-describes* and other ARIA attributes to indicate related elements both within the SVG and between the SVG and the rest of the document.
- You can provide keyboard alternative for interactive elements via JS
